        IN EFFECT FROM 10 AM Monday TO 12 AM Tuesday...\nThe New York State Department
        of Environmental Conservation has\nissued an air quality health advisory for
        the following counties...\nRichmond...Kings...Queens...New York...Bronx...Weschester...Rockland.\nAir
        quality levels in outdoor air are predicted to be greater than an\nair quality
        index value of 100 for fine particles. The air quality\nindex...or AQI...was
        created as an easy way to correlate levels of\ndifferent pollutants to one
        scale. The higher the AQI value, the\ngreater the health concern.\nWhen pollution
        levels are elevated...the New York State Department of\nHealth recommends
        that individuals consider limiting strenuous outdoor\nphysical activity to
        reduce the risk of adverse health effects.  People\nwho may be especially
        sensitive to the effects of elevated levels of\npollutants include the very
        young and those with pre existing respiratory\nproblems such as asthma or
        heart disease.  Those with symptoms should consider\nconsulting their personal
        physician.\nFor additional information, please visit the New York State Department
        of\nEnvironmental Conservation website at, https://on.ny.gov/nyaqi, or call\nthe
        Air Quality Hotline at 800-535-1345."}]}'
